        <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug (1914-2009) was an American agronomist and humanitarian who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production that were termed the Green Revolution.</p>
        <p>Borlaug received his Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He then worked as a microbiologist for DuPont until 1944, when he joined the Rockefeller Foundation's Cooperative Mexican Agricultural Program. In Mexico, he worked to develop high-yielding strains of wheat that were resistant to disease and environmental stress. His success in Mexico spurred the development of similar programs in other countries.</p>
        <p>In 1970, Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in combating world hunger, and he continued his efforts until his death at age 95.</p>
